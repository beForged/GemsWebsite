			Team ART aims to help these students by creating an Augmented Reality program that will help them better keep with their peers.
			 Our team's concept features an AR headset worn by a user that tracks the words they write onto paper. If there is a misplaced or 
			invalid character, the headset would highlight that character and help them correct the mistake, thereby allowing identifying 
			weaknesses and creating immediate feedback. Unlike current market products which only detect syntax and spelling errors, our 
			device also intends to use machine learning to detect characters that have been written incorrectly which is what most dyslexics 
			struggle with.  Another shortcoming of current products is that they only analyze handwriting after the user has finished writing 
			an entire sentence. Team ART plans to implement a LIVE handwriting correction system to create a more intuitive experience.
